# AWS-Solution-Architect-Associate
This is the notes and resources that I used for preparing myself for AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03) exam. The purpose of creating this repository
was to share the mindmaps that I have assigned so much time to create in Xmind software. Next, I wanted to share the sources that I have used for creating this mindmaps.
Also, in the below I brought all the services which are included in the exam. The red ones are the services that are in the exam domain but are not included in the notes.

Creating mindmaps for different AWS services would help in memorizing different features and components of every service for the exam. They 
provide some prepared resources in getting AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03) Certificates easier.
