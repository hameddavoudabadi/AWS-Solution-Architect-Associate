# AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam's mindmaps and notes
This repository has been created to provide notes and guidance in prepartion for AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03) exam. The first purpose of creating this repository was to share the mindmaps that I have assigned so much time to create in Xmind software for my exam. Then, I wanted to share the sources that I have used for creating this mindmaps and preparing for exam.

Correspondingly, [first](#which-key-tools-technologies-and-concepts-might-be-covered-on-the-exam) part is the list of AWS services which are included in the SAA-03 exam.

[Second](#mind-maps-for-aws-services-and-features) part would be the mind maps that I have created by Xmind software to help in remembring exam's stuff.
Since there are more than hundred of services, loading the png files would take some time. The main target of sharing this repository is using the xmind files. In this files you can open and close the branches of every graph and make it easier to read the content. The png files are only for showing the whole content and I don't think will be easy to read them. So, use the xmind files if you want to read, or update the files. You can find the Xmind software [here](http://www.xmind.net/).

Finally, there would be the [resources](#refrences) I have used for this repository.
