# AWS Solution Architect Associate exam's mindmaps and notes
This repository has been created to provide notes and guidance in being prepared for AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-03) exam. The first purpose of creating this repository was to share the mindmaps that I have assigned so much time to create in Xmind software for my exam. Then, I wanted to share the sources that I have used for creating this mindmaps.

Correspondingly, [first](#which-key-tools-technologies-and-concepts-might-be-covered-on-the-exam) part is the list of AWS services which are included in the SAA-03 exam.

[Second](#mind-maps-for-aws-services-and-features) part would be the mind maps that I have created by Xmind software to help in remembring exam's stuff.
Since there are so many services I am trying to update the mindmaps of each segment with the new services which were not in my courses and I have to read about them in other resources. So, this mindmaps will be updating with the passage of time.

Finally, there would be the [resources](#refrences) I have used for this repository.
